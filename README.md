## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an autonomous garden system developed using Raspberry Pi. The system incorporates various servos and motors to manage humidity, weather conditions, and soil health. Additionally, a web application has been created to provide convenient access and control.

## Features

- 🌱 **Humidity Control**: The system is equipped to regulate humidity levels in the garden to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth.

- 🌦️ **Weather Monitoring**: It monitors weather conditions and adjusts the garden environment accordingly.

- 🌱 **Soil Health Management**: The system takes care of soil health by implementing measures for irrigation, nutrient supply, and other relevant parameters.

- ⚙️ **Servo and Motor Integration**: Various servos and motors are utilized to control physical elements within the garden setup, such as irrigation systems and adjustable covers.

- 🍓 **Raspberry Pi**: The Raspberry Pi serves as the central controller, orchestrating the different components of the autonomous garden system.

- 🌐 **Web Application**: A user-friendly web application has been developed to provide remote access and control. Users can monitor the garden's status, adjust settings, and receive real-time data.
